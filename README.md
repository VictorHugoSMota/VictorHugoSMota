#### Hi! I'm a 20-year-old Information Systems student from Brasília, Brazil. I’m passionate about technology and constantly focused on growth, discipline, and building real skills. I enjoy solving problems, understanding how systems work behind the scenes, and transforming ideas into practical solutions. Challenges motivate me because they push me to evolve both technically and personally.

#### My main focus is backend development, especially with Java and Object-Oriented Programming. I also study HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React for front-end development, along with database concepts and system architecture fundamentals. I’m continuously improving my English to expand my global communication and professional opportunities, always aiming to become a well-rounded and impactful software developer.
